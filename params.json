More\r\ndetails on this feature will be made available soon.\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\n\r\nGremlin is entirely plugin-based! What this means is that if you can build an importer plugin\r\nfor any type of file targeting any destination of your choice. Gremlin comes pre-packaged with\r\na document import plugin that allows you to import files to generic apps that declare file type\r\nsupport using QuickLook/LaunchServices. \r\n\r\nIf you require more fine-grained control, or your\r\nparticular target does not support LaunchServices, you can build an import plugin for this\r\npurpose. Once installed your plugin will become automatically available to any application that\r\nuses Gremlin!\r\n\r\n### License terms\r\n\r\nGremlin is licensed under a modified GPLv3 license. In addition to the terms imposed by GPLv3, you may not distribute or use Gremlin whether directly or indirectly for the purposes of financial gain without explicit written consent of the author, Youssef Francis. It is important to note that this policy is\r\ntargeting only specific offenders, my intent is for Gremlin to be used by as many developers and users\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nFor questions regarding licensing, please email me at francis AT yfrancis DOT com."}
